<h2>Initial Commit</h2>
<p>On January 2018, I quit my job of four years. I was a Senior Editor for a scholarly publishing company in Singapore. I started as an Editor. As much as I liked doing what I did, I can't help but feel wasted. I am not quite sure which part of me that felt wasted, however. Was it intellectually or physically?</p>
<p>I had wonderful colleagues, for the most part. We had a terrible system to work with. The technology stack was from the 90s and the management style was from the 80s. It felt like a little watering hole for an array of people: those that can barely make it elsewhere (government or private) and those that wanted to cruise through life on second-gear. </p>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When you need me but do not want me, I will stay. When you don't need me but want me, I will go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it was this line from Nanny McPhee (2005) that captured the moment when I realised that I was wanted but not needed. I replaced someone for a task that I did not need to replace.</p>
<p>When I was promoted to Senior Editor in October 2017, the accomplishment that comes with such a promotion was lacking. Not because the office did not welcome it. I received plenty of congratulatory emails and messages. I just did not feel like I deserved it. Up to that point in time, I just made sure I didn't suck. It felt empty to be promoted because:
1. That meant I didn't suck.
2. That meant that whichever gear I was on, I was sufficient.</p>
<p>I was happy for my colleagues who were promoted around the same term. I suppose this is like getting a medal for a sport or game that you're playing but not competing in. </p>
<p>So what is next? Something nerdy and geeky. It was between Web Development and Data Science. </p>
<h3>All aboard the data-train!</h3>
<p>I did learn what I enjoyed doing in my four years. I enjoyed waddling through an immense amount of data. The more open ended the questions, the better it got. There was an allure in answering questions that nobody was asking and asking question that nobody bothered with. The outcome was not influenced by how nice I was to people, or how well-behaved I was. Data is as emotionally emmutable as it gets. </p>
<p>Web development requires me to hold the hands of sites and apps that I built after I have built it. Not interested in that. </p>
<p>We shall see how this goes. I have signed up for the Data Science Immersive bootcamp at General Assembly. I am not going to blog about my experience there. I will have to get permissions and whatnot for that. I'll just stick it to projects and random programming musings that I stumble upon. </p>
<p>I highly recommend <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">DataCamp</a>. After learning Python, it won't hurt to learn R, SQL and Scala. So DataCamp is longer term investment, while the bootcamp is to make sure I don't sit at home and rot in unemployement.</p>

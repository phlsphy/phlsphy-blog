# Three Months and Much Alcohol Later

> It is necessary to set expectations that they should be prepared to give their life to the course for the next 3 months, â€¦ it with weekly beer busts. Similar to the lifestyle of medieval monks

There were multiple Reddit posts about how under-prepared most people will be. I did the nearly the entire Data Science courses on DataCamp and I still felt like I needed to put in about 50+ more hours to just get the hang of the basics. I appreciate the alcohol much more than I ever did. It gave me the much needed bursts of energy, and reward. 

# Conda Install *

```conda install matplotlib nltk numpy pip setuptools scikit-learn scipy sqlite statsmodels jupyterlab gensim seaborn spacy```

This became very familiar. I learnt that Natural Language Processing is best done in Python 3+. Everything else was best kept in Python 2.7. Don't get me started on Deep Learning stuff like Tensorflow, Keras, etc.

# Conda Uninstall *

Haha. No. Don't worry. I did purge my files only to download them all again to remove any diff errors and weird installations files that I encountered during the course. 

# Source Activate Jobs

I have an internship lined up for 2 months. It is with a startup called [Smartease](http://smartease.sg/). I am going to build something with image recognition, and that's all I can say about it. Sorry! I'll write about it when I am given the green-light.

After that, I have a full-time position at [Electric8 Growth](http://e8growth.com/). A hands-on, digital consultancy that specialises in Product, UX, Design and Growth here in +65, as a Junior Growth Analyst.

# Initial Commit

On January 2018, I quit my job of four years. I was a Senior Editor for a scholarly publishing company in Singapore. I started as an Editor. 

We shall see how this goes. I have signed up for the Data Science Immersive bootcamp at General Assembly. I am not going to blog about my experience there. I will have to get permissions and whatnot for that. I'll just stick it to projects and random programming musings that I stumble upon. 

I highly recommend [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). After learning Python, it won't hurt to learn SQL and Scala.
